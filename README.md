# Switched Control

## Design of switched control laws

This repository contains the code to design switched control laws for discrete-time switched linear systems in the two following cases:
* Arbitrary switching
* Constrained switching

In addition, examples are provided to highlight both techniques. The first case relies on the existence of a common Lyapunov function in order to guarantee asymptotic stability, under arbitrary switching. In the second case, constrained switches are stabilized based on dwell time bounds.
